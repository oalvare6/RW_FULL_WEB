You are a Replit coding agent with full Git access. Implement the “fix-first” items from the Website UX and Credibility Improvements report into this repo (Vite + React + Tailwind). Keep changes realistic (no full redesign), prioritize credibility + speed to action, and avoid heavy dependencies.

Primary file to refactor: src/App.tsx (it’s currently a single-page layout with sections).
Goal: make the site feel like a real asset-based carrier site for brokers + drivers with stronger trust signals, clearer CTAs, and small polish interactions.

NON-NEGOTIABLE ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (must verify in browser before final commit):
1) Persistent Authority Top Bar
- Add a thin dark “authority strip” above the header that stays visible while scrolling (sticky).
- It must display: “MC 1473682”, “DOT 3955747”, and “Spring, TX”.
- It must include a link “FMCSA Snapshot” that opens in a new tab:
  https://safer.fmcsa.dot.gov/query.asp?query_param=USDOT&query_string=3955747&query_type=queryCarrierSnapshot&searchtype=ANY
- The top bar must appear site-wide (on every page/route if routes exist).

2) Hero CTAs
- Update hero copy to be more specific/authentic (Texas-based, flatbed, TX + Southeast).
- Replace generic hero image with a local asset placeholder (keep it <200KB), add alt text.
- Add TWO hero buttons visible on desktop + mobile:
  a) “Book a Load” -> opens a modal QuoteForm
  b) “Drive With Us” -> scrolls to Drivers section or opens recruiting CTA (mailto/form)
- Buttons must have clear hover + focus-visible states.

3) QuoteForm Modal Component
- Create a new component: src/components/QuoteForm.tsx (and any small shared UI helpers).
- “Book a Load” opens the modal. Modal closes on:
  - X button
  - overlay click
  - ESC key
- Fields (exactly these, minimal + clean):
  Name, Company, Email, Phone, Freight Type, Origin, Destination
- On submit:
  - Use Formspree or a simple backend endpoint (choose the easiest). If Formspree:
    - Read endpoint from env var: VITE_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT
    - POST form data to it
  - Show an in-UI success confirmation message after successful submit.
  - Show a simple error state if submit fails (and offer a fallback mailto link to dispatch@riverwaylogistics.com).
- Keep it accessible: focus trap inside modal, focus-visible rings, correct labels.

4) Drivers Section Upgrade
- Make Drivers section more specific:
  - Mention at least: 1 year flatbed experience requirement, TX/SE runs, home time (most weekends), and pay style (“pay range or percentage of line haul available on request”).
  - Add bullets with concrete perks (e.g., weekly settlements, direct dispatch line, no forced dispatch, etc.).
- Change CTA to “Apply Now” and link to:
  mailto:recruiting@riverwaylogistics.com
  (prefill subject like “Driver Application – Riverway”)
- Add a small accordion labeled “More Details” with 4–6 benefit items; smooth open/close animation.

5) Trust & Compliance Section (NEW)
- Insert after Capabilities: a section titled “Trust & Compliance”.
- Include:
  A) Lightweight photo gallery (no external slider library):
     - Use a horizontally scrollable gallery with CSS scroll-snap.
     - 3–6 placeholder images (create a folder public/images/trucks/ with placeholder filenames).
     - Each image must have a short caption (e.g., “Coil load heading to Midland.”).
     - Must be swipeable on mobile.
  B) Collapsible “Docs” entries (accordion or details/summary) for:
     - W-9
     - Insurance Certificate
     - MC Authority
     - Carrier Packet (optional)
     - Use placeholder PDFs stored at public/docs/ (add small dummy PDFs or keep links ready; if no PDFs available, link to “available on request” but keep the UI structure).
     - Each entry expands to reveal a link that opens a PDF in a new tab (or triggers download).

6) Global Styling + Micro-Polish
- Unify type scale (Tailwind-based):
  - h1 ~ 3rem
  - h2 ~ 2rem
  - h3 ~ 1.25rem
  - consistent body size
- Fix spacing inconsistencies between sections (use consistent max-width, padding, section gaps).
- Add hover states for cards/buttons (shadow and subtle transform ok) and ensure focus-visible states for keyboard users.
- Keep the aesthetic blue-collar/simple; no fancy gradients or animations beyond subtle transitions.

7) Back-to-top Button
- Add a subtle floating back-to-top button bottom-right.
- It appears only after user scrolls past ~50% of the page height.
- Clicking smoothly scrolls to top.

OPTIONAL (only if it won’t bloat the project or break the simple flow):
- Split into routes using React Router: / (home), /services, /drivers, /about, /contact
- If you do routing:
  - nav updates URL
  - direct access to each route works
  - hero only on homepage
If routing risks scope creep, skip it and keep anchors + sticky header.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES / CONSTRAINTS
- Prefer small new components over rewriting everything in App.tsx.
- Do not add heavy UI libraries. Use Tailwind + small React components only.
- Ensure mobile layout looks intentional (top bar readable, CTAs visible, modals usable).
- Update or add any assets (images/docs) needed for placeholders.

DELIVERABLES
- Code changes committed to a new branch (or directly if that’s the repo’s flow), with clear commit messages.
- If Formspree is used: update README with setup:
  - how to set VITE_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT
  - how submissions route to dispatch@riverwaylogistics.com
- Provide a short “What changed” summary in the PR/commit description.

Before finalizing:
- Run the dev server and visually verify each acceptance item.
- Verify keyboard navigation for modal + accordions + buttons.
- Verify the FMCSA link opens in a new tab and top bar stays visible while scrolling.

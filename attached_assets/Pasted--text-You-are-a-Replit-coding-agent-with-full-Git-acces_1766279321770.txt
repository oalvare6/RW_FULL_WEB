You are a Replit coding agent with full Git access. Implement the website fixes from the “Website UX and Credibility Improvements” report in this repo (Vite + React + Tailwind). Keep it realistic (no full redesign), prioritize credibility + speed to action, and avoid heavy dependencies.

DECISIONS ALREADY MADE (DO NOT ASK AGAIN)
- Trust & Compliance gallery: use the real photos/videos I provided (they will be available in the Replit workspace).
  - Images: IMG_7654.jpg, IMG_6927.jpg
  - Logo: RIVERWAY LOGO FIXED .png
  - Video: Untitled video (1).mp4
- Docs section: “Available on request” (no PDFs to upload right now), but build the UI structure.
- Hero image: current is fine, but if you can use one of the provided truck images as a more professional hero, do it (optimize file size).
- QuoteForm: use Formspree (I already signed up).
- Routing: keep it simple (single page with anchor links / sections).

ENV VARS
- Use Formspree endpoint from env var: VITE_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT
- If the env var is missing, the UI must show a clear fallback message and a mailto link to dispatch@riverwaylogistics.com.

PRIMARY FILES / STRUCTURE
- Refactor away from dumping everything into App.tsx.
- Create small components under src/components/, e.g.:
  - AuthorityBar.tsx
  - Header.tsx (if needed)
  - QuoteFormModal.tsx (or QuoteForm.tsx + Modal.tsx)
  - Accordion.tsx (lightweight)
  - TrustCompliance.tsx
  - BackToTop.tsx
- Keep Tailwind. Do not add big UI libraries.

NON-NEGOTIABLE ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (verify in browser before final commit)

1) Persistent Authority Top Bar (sticky)
- Add a thin dark “authority strip” above the header that stays visible while scrolling.
- Display: “MC 1473682”, “DOT 3955747”, “Spring, TX”.
- Include a link “FMCSA Snapshot” that opens in a new tab:
  https://safer.fmcsa.dot.gov/query.asp?query_param=USDOT&query_string=3955747&query_type=queryCarrierSnapshot&searchtype=ANY
- Must look clean on mobile (no wrapping into chaos; use compact layout).

2) Hero CTAs + Hero Media
- Update hero copy to be specific and non-generic:
  - Texas-based, asset-based flatbed carrier
  - Core lanes: Texas + Southeast (don’t overpromise nationwide)
- Media:
  - Prefer using one of the provided truck images as hero if it looks better than the current.
  - Optimize hero media (compress, reasonable dimensions, < 250KB if possible).
  - Add proper alt text.
- Add TWO hero buttons (desktop + mobile):
  a) “Book a Load” -> opens QuoteForm modal
  b) “Drive With Us” -> scrolls to Drivers section
- Buttons must have visible hover + focus-visible states.

3) QuoteForm Modal (Formspree)
- Create a modal that opens from “Book a Load”.
- Close behaviors: X button, overlay click, ESC.
- Must be accessible:
  - Focus trap inside modal
  - Focus returns to trigger on close
  - All fields have labels
- Fields (exactly these):
  Name, Company, Email, Phone, Freight Type, Origin, Destination
- Submit:
  - POST to VITE_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT
  - Show success message in UI on 2xx
  - Show error message + fallback mailto:dispatch@riverwaylogistics.com on failure
- Add basic client-side validation: required fields + email format.

4) Drivers Section Upgrade (more real, less generic)
- Rewrite with concrete info:
  - Minimum 1 year flatbed experience
  - TX/SE runs
  - Home time: most weekends (word it carefully: “most weekends”)
  - Pay: “Pay details available on request” (keep it clean)
- CTA button: “Apply Now”
  - mailto:recruiting@riverwaylogistics.com
  - Prefill subject: “Driver Application – Riverway”
- Add “More Details” accordion (4–6 items) with smooth open/close:
  Example items:
  - Weekly settlements
  - Direct dispatch communication
  - No forced dispatch (if true; if unsure, phrase as “We work with you on routes”)
  - Modern equipment expectations / safety-first
  - Consistent lanes (TX/SE focus)
  - Quick onboarding

5) NEW “Trust & Compliance” Section
Place after Capabilities/Services.

A) Gallery (real media)
- Create a horizontally scrollable gallery with CSS scroll-snap (NO slider library).
- Use the provided images (and optionally 1 short video tile if it looks clean):
  - IMG_7654.jpg
  - IMG_6927.jpg
  - Untitled video (1).mp4 (optional, only if it doesn’t hurt layout/perf; keep it muted, controls optional)
- Each tile must have a short caption, e.g.:
  - “Flatbed load secured and ready to roll.”
  - “Texas-based flatbed operations.”
- Mobile must be swipeable; desktop scroll should feel intentional.

IMPORTANT: Move assets into sensible public paths:
- public/images/trucks/...
- public/video/... (if used)
Rename files to web-safe names, e.g.:
- riverway-truck-1.jpg
- riverway-truck-2.jpg
- riverway-yard.mp4
Also compress images (use a simple local approach or library-free). If you can’t compress in Replit, at least resize and avoid huge loads.

B) Collapsible Docs (Available on request)
- Build an accordion or details/summary list for:
  - W-9
  - Insurance Certificate
  - MC Authority
  - Carrier Packet (optional)
- Each expands to show:
  - Status: “Available on request”
  - CTA button: “Request via Email” -> mailto:dispatch@riverwaylogistics.com with subject “Carrier Docs Request – Riverway”
- Do NOT fake PDFs. Keep it honest.

6) Global Styling + Micro-Polish
- Unify typography and spacing across sections:
  - Consistent max width container
  - Consistent section padding and gaps
  - Headings scale (h1, h2, h3) and body text consistent
- Add subtle hover states to cards/buttons (shadow, slight translate ok).
- Ensure focus-visible rings for keyboard navigation.
- Keep it blue-collar/simple (no flashy animations, no over-designed gradients).

7) Back-to-top Button
- Floating bottom-right.
- Appears after user scrolls past ~50% page height.
- Smooth scroll to top on click.

KEEP IT SIMPLE (explicit)
- Do not add routing. Keep single-page with anchor scrolling.
- Keep dependencies minimal.
- Avoid scope creep.

DELIVERABLES
- Implement all above in code with clean component structure.
- Update any existing sections’ copy so it sounds like a real carrier (direct, specific, not corporate).
- Ensure logo usage is clean:
  - Use “RIVERWAY LOGO FIXED .png” where appropriate (header/footer).
  - If the logo file name has spaces, rename to riverway-logo.png and update references.
- Run dev server and verify each acceptance criterion.
- Commit with clear messages (e.g., “Add authority bar + hero CTAs”, “Add QuoteForm modal (Formspree)”, “Add Trust & Compliance section”, etc.).
- If helpful, add a short README note:
  - Set VITE_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT
  - What the form does
  - Fallback behavior

FINAL CHECKLIST BEFORE YOU STOP
- Authority bar visible + sticky + FMCSA link opens new tab
- Hero shows 2 CTAs and looks good on mobile
- Quote modal accessible and submits to Formspree env endpoint
- Drivers section has “Apply Now” mailto + accordion works smoothly
- Trust & Compliance gallery scroll-snap works + captions present
- Docs list shows “Available on request” and has request mailto links
- Back-to-top appears after scrolling and works
- No broken imports, no console errors, no layout blowups on mobile
```
